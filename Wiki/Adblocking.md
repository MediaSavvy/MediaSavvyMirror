### Adblockers for Android:

1. ⭐ [AdGuard](https://modyolo.com/download/adguard-28793/4)

::: danger Note:
- For Adguard to block ads better you need to edit some of the setting. To do this go to `Settings > Filtering > Filters` and enable all of the Ad filters, the first 6 privacy filters, all of the annoyance filters and if you want enable some language-specific filters. 
- Don't enable HTTPS filtering, it stops some sites from loading.
:::
