# üöÄ Beginners guide to piracy
### The basics of pirating and how to stay safe and more.

## What you need to know:

- Read the FAQ about piracy below.

- If you are torrenting be sure to use a VPN to not get DMCA letters from your ISP. I recommend a paid VPN for torrenting such as Mullvad or ProtonVPN. If you want to use a free VPN you can use Cloudflare WARP or RiseUP VPN. Note: WARP has a 1GB limit. I'll be making a guide on how to do this soon. Also make sure you use a good Bittorent client. DO NOT use any torrent client that is listed in the [unsafe programs and websites list!](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/UnsafeSites)I recommend using qBittorent. If you are downloading a program or game make sure to scan it with VirusTotal (www.virustotal.com) and scan all the .exe or .apk or .dmg files to scan for malware. Note: if it shows something like hacking tool or patcher or crack or anything like that its most likely a false positive. Also make sure that you look at popular antiviruses and not once you've never heard of before to minimize false positives.

- If you are going to use direct downloads which I HIGHLY recommend for beginners then first things first, make sure that you have an [adblocker](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/Adblocking.html) and the [Fastforward](https://github.com/FastForwardTeam/FastForward) extension to bypass annoying redirects! Next browse this wiki's catelogue and once you found a website to stream or download from go to the website and do what you want to do. If you are downloading a program or game make sure to scan it with VirusTotal (www.virustotal.com) and scan all the .exe or .apk or .dmg files to scan for malware. Note: if it shows something like hacking tool or patcher or crack or anything like that its most likely a false positive. Also make sure that you look at popular antiviruses and not once you've never heard of before to minimize false positives.

- SCAN ALL EXECUTABLE FILES WITH VIRUSTOTAL to scan for malware. Only use trusted websites from this wiki. Also make sure to check this wiki often to make sure that a site you use hasn't been caught with malware.

- If you are streaming movies/tv shows and it's buffering, you can try [FastStream](https://FastStream.online). FastStream downloads video fragments in parallel. Up to 6x faster download speeds for videos, ensuring smooth playback with no interruptions. 

## üó£Ô∏è Frequently Asked Questions about piracy:

::: details How do I tell if a site or download is safe? 
1. When torrenting, make sure you use a good VPN, [go here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/adblock-vpn-privacy/#wiki_.25BA_vpn) for good VPN recommendations. I also recommend you using the qBittorent torrent client. Note: Make sure you bind your VPN to your torrent client. [Go here](https://rentry.org/bootyguard#3-configure-your-torrent-client) for a guide on how to do that with qBittorent.

2. Use ad blockers! Many websites you visit to pirate stuff has malicious, scam and intrusive ads. [Go here](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/Adblocking.html#adblockers-for-your-browser) for my guide on how to install the best ad blocker on your browser.

3. Only download from trusted sources to avoid getting malware. [Go here](https://mediasavvy.pages.dev/Wiki/) to check out my wiki, which only lists the best and safest options.

4. Scan files you download online using something like [Virustotal](https://virustotal.com) to scan files and folders to ensure that you aren't gonna open malware. Virustotal is a tool that is used by many people (especially pirates) to make sure that their downloaded content is safe. However I recommend instead of downloading the software on your device and scanning it like that, you should instead use VTonColab to scan files before downloading them, which is much safer. Follow [this guide](https://rentry.co/vtoncolab) to show you how you can do that. Note: Make sure that when you are using VTonCOlab that you use dummy accounts for your privacy and safety.

5. Finally, use your common sense.

::: details How can I download Adobe products?
You can download pre-cracked Adobe products from [M0nkrus](https://w14.monkrus.ws/) (make sure to use a VPN when downloading from M0nkrus because they are torrents! Also make sure that you DO NOT download collections as they have been accused of having malware on multiple occasions, stick to individual packages) or crack them yourself using the guides [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenP/wiki/index/) (no need for a VPN).

::: details What antivirus should I use?
You really don't need anything other than Windows Defender and an occasional Malwarebytes scan, having other antiviruses is unnecessary and bloatware.

::: details How can I download images from ___ stock site for free?
You can use https://downloader.la or https://getpaidstock.com.

::: details What are the differences between direct downloads and torrents?
Direct downloads are files or streams directly downloaded or streamed from a specific server, and often uses encryption to hide what you are downloading or doing on the website. Direct downloads do not need any VPN. Torrents are files or streams that are downloaded or streamed from someone else's device using the P2P protocol. This method NEEDS a VPN.
